Obfuscript is a free windows obfuscator created for protecting the code of .NET Softwares. Obfuscript is **free** and **customizable** for all developers. You can create licenses, file locks and much, much more.

# Why Obfuscript?
Obfuscript is a very advanced, fast, smart obfuscator and is **FREE** unlike obfuscators like VMProtect, dotNet reactor.

# Is Obfuscript open-source?
Unfortunetely, Obfuscript is **NOT** open-source. Mainly because of users on the internet "skidding" or stealing the source and claiming it's theirs. Of course, you can decompile Obfuscript but it's actually obfuscated itself.
